This one case is generally regarded as the most crucial in the build-up to battle. Bosnia was a territory in Austria Hungary's southernmost province. Many Bosnians wished to have their own country and be free of Austro-Hungarian control. Serbia, which lies just south of the Austria-Hungarian border, also desired the freedom of the Bosnians. Serbia was an ally of the powerful Russian Empire, while Austria-Hungary was an ally of Germany. Bosnian nationalists (those who wanted Bosnia to be its own country) saw Archduke Ferdinand's visit to Sarajevo as an opportunity to strike at the Austrian Empire. Assassins were recruited and trained with the assistance of Serbia to destroy the Archduke as he drove through the streets of Sarajevo. These assassins were members of a terrorist organization known as the Black Hand. On June 28, 1914, Franz Ferdinand and his wife were riding in the third car of a motorcade to the Town Hall in Sarajevo. Several assassins from the Black Hand were stationed along the route.The first assassination attempt took place on the way to the Town Hall. Nedeljko Cabrinovic, a man, threw a bomb into the Archduke's car. The bomb, however, bounced off the car and landed under the next vehicle in the procession. The Archduke's car was able to get away quickly and safely arrive at the Town Hall.The assassins, on the other hand, did not give up. The motorcade made a wrong turn on the way back. Another gunman, Gavrilo Princip, happened to be right next to the car as the driver started to back up. He took advantage of the situation and started shooting at the Archduke. He fired two shots, one at the Archduke and the other at his wife Sophie. The two were dead within the hour and Princip was arrested and sentenced to the maximum 20 years that he a man his age was allowed to be.`,\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tkey: 1,\n\t\t\ttitle: \"Blank cheque\", \n\t\t\tdate: new Date(1914, 6, 5, 10, 33, 30),\n\t\t\tdescription: \"Austria-Hungary considered military action against Serbia after the assassination of the heir to the throne.

On July 5, 1914, Emperor Franz-Joseph of Austria-Hungary wrote to Kaiser Wilhelm II, stating that he was contemplating military action against Serbia. His motivation was the assassination of Archduke Franz-Ferdinand, the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, in Sarajevo only a few days before.The Emperor and his top officials believed Serbia, a neighboring country, was behind the assassination and had provided the assassins with instructions and weapons.

Serbia, on the other hand, met the majority of the demands in its response of July 25, 1914. While Kaiser Wilhelm II said that he could no longer see a justification for war, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia on the same day.Following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife, the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, in Sarajevo, the Habsburgs felt threatened in their status as a great power. Serbia was believed to be behind the assault by Austria-Hungary. However, there was no proof that the Serbian government was involved in or knew anything about the assassination.Nevertheless, Vienna decided to issue a tough ultimatum to Serbia in the expectation, and indeed hope, that this would be rejected. It was likely that the great power of Russia would take Serbia’s side in the conflict. Meanwhile, Austria-Hungary had received the aforementioned “blank cheque” from Berlin, in which the German Kaiser wrote that he would “stand loyally by Austria-Hungary in accordance with his treaty obligations and in old friendship”.Despite its assertion that it was already conducting its own internal investigation, the Serbian government would have to allow an Austro-Hungarian inquiry into the assassination under the terms of the ultimatum issued on July 23. Serbia was also required to suppress all anti-Austrian propaganda and take measures to identify and eradicate terrorist groups operating within its borders--The Black Hand, for example, is suspected of assisting and abetted the archduke's murderer, Gavrilo Princip, and his cohorts by supplying arms and safe passage from Belgrade to Sarajevo. The Dual Monarchy requested that the note be answered within 48 hours. However, the Ambassador sent to negotiate, Gieslingen, had already packed his things and prepared to leave the embassy, expecting Serbian defiance.\",\t\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tkey: 3, \n\t\t\ttitle: \"Austria-Hungary Declares War on Serbia\", \n\t\t\tdate: new Date(1914, 6, 28, 10, 33, 30),\n\t\t\tdescription: \"This came about as a result of the general unsatisfaction with the refusal of Serbia to fully submit to the terms of the Habsburg's ultimatum. After receiving an 'unsatisfactory response' from the Serbian government, the Austro-Hungarian government issued a statement signed by Count Berchtold declaring that it ‘finds it necessary itself to safeguard its rights and interests, and to have recourse for this purpose to force of arms. Austria-Hungary, therefore, considers itself from this moment in a state of war with Serbia.'As Austria-Emperor Hungary's Franz Josef ordered mobilization against Serbia and Russia's Tsar Nicholas II ordered \\\"pre-mobilization\\\" measures and contemplated mobilization against Austria-Hungary, the wheels of fate were turning. However, since no one had declared war yet, there was still a hope that an agreement could be made, giving Austria-Hungary a diplomatic victory.This declaration of war is what antagonized Austria-Hungary and Germany and gave them to title as the starters of the war. Despite mounting evidence that Austria-war Hungary's against Serbia would not be limited to the Balkans, they managed to dismiss warnings from Russia, France, the United Kingdom, and Italy as bluff and went ahead with their strategy, using deceit to make it seem as though diplomacy had a chance despite never planning to negotiate.\",\t\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tkey: 4, \n\t\t\ttitle: \"Tsar Nicholas Authorizes Russian Mobilization\", \n\t\t\tdate: new Date(1914, 6, 30, 10, 33, 30),\n\t\t\tdescription: \"Due to it's ties with Serbia, Russia was thrust into the war.

The Germans were not worried because they knew that the mobilization of the Russian army would take a long time. However, when Russia entered the first world war, it had the largest standing army in the world with a total of 5 million soldiers. The only problem came from the army’s inability to transport troops to enemy territory in a short amount of time. When they faced Germany, they were unable to adapt to the industrialized warfare on the battlefield and would be easily annihilated. Russia’s allied country, France, gave Russia money to build railways for the cause of mobilizing and transporting troops. Even still, they were still very disorganized during times of mobilization. They sometimes even advanced without back up in the form of cavalry and aircraft. Even though Russia’s army might have been threatening to the Germans because of it’s size, they had many drawbacks that would prevent them from being a victor.\",\t\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tkey: 5, \n\t\t\ttitle: \"Germany declares war on Russia.

On the 2nd of August, the German ultimatum to Belgium gave King Albert and his government the choice of fighting or being conquered. They chose to be conquered and Germany advanced into Belgium. Throughout the war Germany committed a multitude of atrocities which came to be none as the 'Rape of Belgium'. However, it seems that, rumors, such as the claim that German troops were chopping off the right hands of male children, inflated stories of German assaults on civilians and the burning of towns and villages. The approaching German forces forced a wave of Belgian refugees to escape. King Albert retreated the majority of his army to Antwerp, which had a fortified perimeter, determined to resume the battle but unable to face the Germans in the region. The German 1st Army surrendered Brussels to annexation. South of Namur, in the direction of the German 2nd Army, the fortress complex of Namur held on for just three days after the German siege guns arrived on August 21. Though the German Army managed to push the sitting government out of Belgium, they could not move through the country on the count of the superb resistance of the Belgian Army. They managed to slow the Germans and bought the Allies, much valued time. It seemed an Allied Victory in that regard but Belgium were not part of the Allies and the Belgians suffered the death of 766,000 men. \",\t\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tkey: 7, \n\t\t\ttitle: \"Britain Declares War on Germany\", \n\t\t\tdate: new Date(1914, 7, 4, 10, 33, 30),\n\t\t\tdescription: \"Britain was more worried with Russia and France than Germany until the early 1900s. The United Kingdom and Germany had excellent relations. However, everything started to improve. As Kaiser Wilhelm II ascended to the throne of Germany, he wished for the country to become a great power. He believed that Germany was being encircled by Russia to the east and France to the west. As a result, he bolstered his military. France and Russia both hated Germany and acted accordingly. Many of Europe's major powers started to build up their armies and navies throughout the 1900s. British policy demanded that a distance remain between them and the other European Powers. Russia, France, Germany, and Austria-Hungary would be less of a threat to Britain if they were concerned about each other. By 1907, it was becoming apparent that Germany would be the biggest possible threat to the United Kingdom. Germany seemed to be capable of conquering Europe due to its robust economy, massive population, and aggressive military forces. Because of this, Britain started to collude with Russia and France, the two biggest powers aside from Britain and Germany. Together they formed the Triple Entente to stop Germany from trying to do anything. Despite being a member of the Triple Entente, Britain did not want to fight in 1914. Sir Edward Grey, the Foreign Secretary, spent most of the summer of 1914 frantically seeking to persuade Russia and Germany and avoid a war. Britain did not have to go to battle when German forces occupied France and Belgium as part of the Schlieffen Plan. Germany hoped the United Kingdom would stay out of the conflict entirely. The Germans, on the other hand, were aware that under the Treaty of London of 1839, Britain pledged to protect Belgium. The Germans wanted Britain to disregard the Treaty of London and allow the German army to travel through Belgium, but the British did not agree.  Britain declared war on Germany within hours. Within a few more days, Britain, France and Russia (the Allies) were all officially at war with Germany and Austria-Hungary (the Central Powers). What had started as a small, local problem in the Balkans was turning into the biggest and most brutal war the world had ever seen.\",\t\n\t\t},\n\t]\n\n\tlet mappedEvents = events.map((event: {key: number, title: string, date: Date, description: string})=>{\n\t\treturn <Event event={event}/>\n\t})\n\n\treturn (\n\t\t<div className=\"App\">\n\t\t\t<Slide/>\n\t\t\t{mappedEvents}\n\t\t\t<TrenchDrawing/>\n\t\t\t<Weapons/>\n\t\t</div>\n\t);\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\n\nReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
